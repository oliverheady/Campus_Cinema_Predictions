# Campus_Cinema_Predictions
Used Python to build and execute a linear regression analysis on a campus cinema dataset.


The cinema.xlsx dataset contains the following variables:

Rating: The movie’s MPAA rating (PG, PG-13, R).

Rottentom: The movie’s Rotten Tomatoes percentage rating (i.e., the percentage of movie critics who reviewed the movie positively).

Metacrit: The movie’s cumulative rating on Metacritic (effectively an average of all critics’ ratings on a scale from 0-100).

Wks: Number of weeks since the movie’s initial US release.

Sportevent: Whether the campus was hosting a major sporting event during the same week the movie was shown.

Budget: The movie’s budget (in millions of US dollars).

Genre: The movie’s genre (action, comedy, or drama).

Attend: The movie’s total attendance for the week it was shown.
